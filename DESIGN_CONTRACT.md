Figma screenshots in /public/images/figma/ are the only design authority.

Do not change typography scale, spacing, overlay strength, or section heights unless explicitly matching Figma.

No “standard hero patterns”, no “improvements”.

If unsure, keep existing values unchanged.

Images must reference real filenames that exist in /public/images/figma/ (no URL encoding).

One section at a time.
